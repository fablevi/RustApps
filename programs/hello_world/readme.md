# How to do it

Build an app: 

    cargo new hello_world

Move to the folder directory: 

    cd hello_world

Build an app from this hello world:

    cargo build

This will make a 'target' folder. You can see a debug/deps folder. Move to this directory and run the 'hello_world_(some_id)' file from terminal ðŸ™‚
